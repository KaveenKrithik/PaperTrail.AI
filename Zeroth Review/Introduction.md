# Introduction to Project

Business documents govern financial and legal decisions, yet verification is still largely manual. Manual review is slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when auditors must cross-check totals, dates, parties, and compliance clauses across dense documents. These gaps lead to missed inconsistencies, delayed approvals, and compliance risk.

PaperTrail.AI addresses this problem by providing an AI-driven audit workflow that is both autonomous and explainable. The platform ingests documents, extracts structured data, runs consistency and compliance checks, calculates a risk score, and generates a verification report with evidence references. Its skeptical-auditor logic challenges claims by default and supports a counter-auditor review when users dispute findings, making the system trustworthy and transparent.

This project focuses on building a product-grade MVP that delivers an end-to-end audit for a single document, while establishing a roadmap for advanced features such as visual evidence overlays, cross-document verification, and automated ingestion. The zeroth review document captures the product vision, backlog, SDG justification, and planned release timeline.
