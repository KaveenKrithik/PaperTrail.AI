# Abstract

PaperTrail.AI is an autonomous, multimodal AI platform that verifies business documents with evidence-backed reasoning. The system reads contracts, invoices, and financial reports, extracts structured facts, checks internal consistency, validates user-defined compliance rules, and produces a risk-scored audit report. A skeptical-auditor pipeline and a counter-auditor option reduce false positives, while evidence mapping links every finding to exact text or visual regions for human verification. The platform is designed to reduce manual audit effort, detect inconsistencies early, and improve compliance transparency. This zeroth review package defines the product vision, feature backlog, SDG alignment, and a phased roadmap for building a reliable MVP within a semester timeline.
